## Overview
1. CPU vs GPU
2. Deep Learning Frameworks
- Caffe / Caffe2
- Theano / TensorFlow
- Torch / PyTorch
## CPU vs GPU
1. GPU built for rendering in graphics.
2. CPU with fewer cores, but each core is much faster and much more capable -> great at sequential tasks.
3. GPU with more cores, but each core is much slower and "dumber" -> great at parallel tasks.
