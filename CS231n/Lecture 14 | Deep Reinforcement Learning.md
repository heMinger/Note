1. What is Reinforcement Learning
2. Markov Decision Chain
3. Q-Learning
4. Policy Gradients

# Reinforcement Learning
1. an agent and an environment
2. environment give the agent a state
3. agent take an action
4. environment give back a reward + next state
5. go back to 2 and loop

# Markov Decision Chain
1. mathematical formulation of RL
- S: set of possible states
- A: set of possible actions
- R: distribution of reward given a state and action pair, a function mapping from state and action to reward.
- P: transition probability distribution over next state.
- $\Gamma$: discount factor, which is basically saying how much we value rewards coming up soon versus later on.
