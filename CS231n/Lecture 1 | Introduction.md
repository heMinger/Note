# history of CV
1. if object recognition is too hard, maybe we should first do object segmentation. \
**image segemetation**: we group pixels into meaningful areas, even though we don't know the specific meaning of this area.
(There must be something I lost.)
2. SIFT: feature based object recognition
  identify critical features on the object, then match the features to a similar obeject; eaiser than match the entire object.
3. humain recognition:
   one work: histogram of gradients
   the other: deformable part model
4. growth of internet & digital camera and so on: important benchmark dataset: PASCAL Visual Obect Challenge
5.  complex input and many parameters -> lack of training data cause bottleneck of overfitting
   - dual reason of begin project ImageNet \
   - want to recognize the world of all the objects
   - come back the machine learning, overcome the machine learning bottleneck of voerfitting
